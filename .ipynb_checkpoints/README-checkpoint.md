Project Title:

Team Member's Names & Github Usernames:
Cole Gaito /gaitocole, Jake Sandelin /JakeSandelinColorado, Kyle Tomlinson /KT-Boulder, Alex Sueppel /asueppel

Vision Statement:
The vision for our group project is to create a task list that will notify individuals via text or other communication means that they have a waiting task.  Overall we wanted something that a user could set up through the web portal, but have the application interact with them through additional means.  We also wanted something that would be flexible enough that could be scaled and adapt to the various tools that we use and encounter.

Motivation:
Our motivation behind using and creating this applicaiton is that it will provide us as designers the ability to configure a lot of different aspects of this program without necessarily using an API.  While these are good, we as a team want the ability to learn about the entire process from start to finish, to better prepare ourselves for future projects.

Risks:
Some of the risks associated with the project is that texting will be difficult to achieve.  Communicating to the end user that they set the tasks or goals they want to be reminded of, and the time intervals.  We were also concerrned that we might run out of tasks, but we can add additional features and functionality as we see fit.

Mitigation Strategy for the Above Risks:
Working together we can pool our knowledge from design, databases and features/functionality to create something that will meet the requirements put forth for the project.

Development Method:
I think agile will work best, being able to itirate through multiple functionality and versions of the software will provide each groupmember the skill development and time to engage contribute and grow.

Project Tracking:
Github Project (probably)
